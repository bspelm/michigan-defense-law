                            </p><h2>Michigan OWI Laws Overview</h2><p>In the state of Michigan, you can be charged with a drunk driving offense (<a href="https://www.michigandefenselaw.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-dui-owi-owpd-and-owvi-charges-in-michigan/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">OWI </a>or OWVI) if you operate your vehicle while you are under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. This is a serious offense that can have major consequences, including jail time, fines, community service, DUI school, driver responsibility fees, and SR-22 insurance requirements. If you are facing OWI charges, it is important to contact a Michigan OWI Lawyer as soon as possible so that you can have an experienced attorney protect your rights and interests.
<br>
<br>When you obtained your license to drive in the state of Michigan, you agreed to comply with a law known as implied consent. This law states that you consent to allow a police officer to perform a blood, breath, or urine test if they suspect that you are operating your vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. If you refuse to comply with this law, it will result in your license being suspended or revoked.
<br>
<br>Before 2003, the standard for a conviction of drunk driving in the state of Michigan was a BAC level of.10. However, Michigan legislators enacted laws in that year that dropped the legal BAC level to .08 and also changed the name of the offense from "Operating Under the Influence of Liquor'' to "Operating While Intoxicated." The new OWI law retains a separate offense of driving while visibly impaired, which requires that a person's ability to drive was substantially lessened by the use of alcohol or other intoxicating substances.
<br>
<br>Although the BAC level has changed in the state of Michigan, other aspects of the OWI laws have not. For example, prosecutors must still prove that a person's ability to drive has been substantially lessened by the use of alcohol or intoxicating substances, and they must also be able to show that the person's physical coordination was diminished. The new OWI law also allows a prosecutor to charge a person with OWI even when the person's BAC is below .08, as long as the prosecution can also show that a person's mental coordination was impaired by the use of drugs or other intoxicating substances.
<br>
<br>It is important to remember that an OWI conviction will have serious consequences and can affect your reputation, your job, and your family life. A Michigan OWI Lawyer can assist you in navigating through the complex laws and helping you avoid the most severe punishments.

                            </p><h2>Penalties for OWI Offenses in Michigan</h2><p>When an individual in Michigan is charged with a drunk driving offense, it is serious. The penalties can include jail time, significant fines, a lengthy license suspension, and more. The penalties vary depending on how many prior convictions a person has, the BAC at the time of the arrest, and whether or not there were children in the car. In addition, a third DUI offense results in felony charges and much harsher penalties.
<br>
<br>Michigan's drunk driving laws are complex and often difficult to understand. A Michigan OWI lawyer can explain the law and what it means to be found guilty of a drunk driving offense. The first step in a Michigan OWI defense is to question the validity of the evidence against you. This includes examining witness testimony, which is often fallible and based on human perceptions and interpretations.
<br>
<br>A good lawyer will also look at the specific circumstances surrounding your arrest, which is critical to a successful drunk driving defense. For example, the attorney will examine the police report to see if there are inconsistencies and holes in the investigation. If there are, the defense team can use those inconsistencies and holes to your advantage in court.
<br>
<br>The attorney will also consider what type of alcohol or drugs you were taking at the time of your arrest. Prior to 2003, prosecutors could only charge people with DUIs if they had a BAC of 0.08% or higher. But since then, the law has been revised and prosecutors can now use OWI charges against people with a BAC below the legal limit, as long as they can prove that the person's ability to drive was significantly impaired due to the drug or alcohol intoxication.
<br>
<br>If you are convicted of a first-offense OWI, your license will be suspended for 30 days followed by 150 days of restricted driving privileges. In addition, the judge can order that your vehicle be confiscated, unless you can demonstrate that it is necessary to get to and from work, alcohol treatment programs, or community service.
<br>
<br>A second OWI or OWVI within seven years of a previous OWI or OWVI is considered a felony and leads to increased criminal penalties, including jail time and a lifetime revocation of your driver's license. A conviction can also result in your insurance rates going through the roof, making it even more important to hire an experienced drunk driving defense attorney.

                            </p><h2>Blood Alcohol Content Limits for a Michigan OWI</h2><p>A conviction for OWI in Michigan results in severe penalties, including jail time and license suspension. A driver’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is the most common measure used by law enforcement officers to determine whether a person is above the legal limit to operate a motor vehicle.
<br>
<br>The state’s standard BAC limit is 0.08%. It takes about three to four drinks for most people to reach this level. However, many factors affect a person’s BAC, such as diet and food consumption, body composition, and how quickly the alcohol is absorbed by the system. This is why it is important to contact a qualified Michigan OWI lawyer if you are accused of driving with a high BAC.
<br>
<br>In addition to criminal penalties, a high BAC conviction will also result in additional administrative sanctions such as mandatory attendance at alcohol education programs, drug addiction treatment, and self-help groups, and a driver’s license suspension. The purpose of these sanctions is to encourage responsible behavior and deter repeated excessive drinking.
<br>
<br>If a person is arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, it can often be determined that the driver was over the legal limit to drive by virtue of their demeanor, behavior, and scent. The driver may also be found to be over the legal limit for impaired driving based on the evidence from a breath or blood test.
<br>
<br>One of the most serious offenses an individual can face is a high BAC DUI, which is known throughout the country as “super drunk” OWI. These cases are characterized by a high BAC, prior offenses, and the severity of the injuries that were caused as a result of the crash. This type of case carries a heavier punishment than other drunk driving charges, which is why it is so vital to seek the assistance of a Michigan OWI lawyer as soon as possible.
